# Cooperative and Web3.0 Synergies

## Purpose

This note is for jotting down possible opportunities where Web3.0 technologies and cooperatives (generally centered on tech and platform cooperatives) can come together to provide free and open source technologies to users that can preserve user-autonomy and instill democratic governance.
