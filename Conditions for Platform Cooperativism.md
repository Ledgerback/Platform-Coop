# Purpose

Thoughts on the conditions that may make a platform cooperative a better business model than others or alternatively, conditions where a platform cooperative business model makes sense.

*Preliminary for now.*

## Possible Conditions

- User Awareness
  - Users of platform coops are more aware of issues in the sharing economy and platform capitalism than the general public.
  - Users of a platform (generally the labor-side stakeholder) cannot access information about the Platform or the Platform-owner is not transparent about certain information with users that may be considered vital (e.g., algorithms, software, finances, data collection)
- Power imbalances
  - One side of the Platform has a major power imbalance with the Platform owner (e.g., content creators on YouTube) and usually feels the most pain when a new governance decision is made. This can be regarding:
    - Governance (pricing, decision-making, etc.)
    - Architecture
- Labor reliance
  - One-side of the platform's stakeholders are generally content and data generators. If the stakeholders are the primary source of input for the Platform, then the stakeholder may consider having more say in the Platform's governance or challenging the Platform owner.
- Multiple Stakeholders
  - If the Platform-owner must appease multiple stakeholders, internally and/or externally, then the governance of the platform must take into account the diverse views of the stakeholders. If the Platform-owner cannot appease all stakeholders, then there may be an extra incentive for a stakeholder group to leave and form their own similar but alternative platform.
